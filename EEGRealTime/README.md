# EEG_RealTime
Code for real-time closed-loop EEG data acquisition, analysis, &amp; dynamic stimulus presentation
Primary author: Ying Yang (yingyan1@andrew.cmu.edu)

*Developed for use on 64-bit Windows 7 on a System76 machine with Python 2.7, FieldTrip's biosemi2ft acquisition tool, PsychoPy, MNE-Python, and Anaconda, in conjunction with the BioSemi 128-channel EEG recording system using the ActiveTwo AD-Box and AIB box with a USB2 reciever connected to a 32-bit parallel port as found in the EEG Lab at the Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh PA. Use of 32-bit parallel port on a 64-bit system requires installation of a 32-bit port driver interface; [inpout32](http://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/inpout32/) was used on our system and included in the Windows DLL search path.*

###test_real_time_one_session.py
Wraps session into one object. FieldTrip buffer client is stored as a field, and trigger values are read in real-time to control the display of a simple checkerboard experiment (alternate based on last trigger sent).
